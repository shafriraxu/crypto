This repository is currently being developed by the project group [qFALL - quantum resistant fast lattice library](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cuk/lehre/veranstaltungen/ws-2022-23/project-group-qfall) in the winter term 2022 and summer term 2023 by the Codes and Cryptography research group in Paderborn.

The main objective of this project is to provide researchers and students with the possibility to easily and quickly prototype (lattice-based) cryptography.

## Disclaimer
Currently, we are in the development phase and interfaces might change.
Feel free to check out the current progress, but be aware, that the content will
change in the upcoming weeks and months. An official release will most likely be published in the second half of 2023.

## Quick-Start

Please refer to [our website](https://qfall.github.io/) as central information point.

To install and add our library to your project, please refer to [our tutorial](https://qfall.github.io/book/index.html).
It provides a step-by-step guide to install the required libraries and gives further insights in the usage of our crates.
